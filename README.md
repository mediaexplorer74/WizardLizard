## My 2 cents (status)
- Fast R.E.... db connection not ready yet, sadly... So, game "unplayeble" :(
- Project tuned on(to) "firm" Monigame.Framwork 3.8.xx...
- "Game arch research" and minimal "reconstruct"...
- W10(M) UWP template ready... but all things damaged at now ("Game components" is hardcore!)
- Screen auto-resizing implemeted partially.
